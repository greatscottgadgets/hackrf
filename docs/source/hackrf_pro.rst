HackRF Pro is the current hardware platform for the HackRF project. It is a Software Defined Radio peripheral capable of transmission or reception of radio signals from 100 kHz to 6 GHz. HackRF Pro is designed to be backwards compatible with software and hardware developed for use with
:ref:`HackRF One <hackrf_one>`,
whilst introducing many new features and improvements.
