rad1o is the badge from the 2015 Chaos Communication Camp.

The rad1o badge contains a full-featured SDR (software defined radio) half-duplex transceiver, operating in a frequency range of about 50 MHz - 4000 MHz, and is software compatible to the HackRF.

Compared to HackRF One, the rad1o badge uses a different mixer (MAX2871) with a reduced frequency range.
