HackRF Pro
~~~~~~~~~~

When HackRF Pro is plugged in to a USB host, four LEDs should turn on: MCU, FPGA, RF, and USB. The MCU LED indicates that the primary internal power supply is working properly and that firmware is running. The FPGA and RF LEDs indicate that firmware has switched on additional internal power supplies. The USB LED indicates that the HackRF Pro is communicating with the host over USB.

HackRF One
~~~~~~~~~~

When HackRF One is plugged in to a USB host, four LEDs should turn on: 3V3, 1V8, RF, and USB. The 3V3 LED indicates that the primary internal power supply is working properly. The 1V8 and RF LEDs indicate that firmware is running and has switched on additional internal power supplies. The USB LED indicates that the HackRF One is communicating with the host over USB.

Both versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The RX and TX LEDs indicate that a receive or transmit operation is currently in progress.

Each LED is a single color. There are no multi-colored LEDs on either HackRF One or HackRF Pro. Adjacent LEDs are different colors in order to make them easier to distinguish from one another. The colors do not mean anything.
