/**
 * @defgroup library Library related functions and enums
 * 
 * @brief Library initialization, exit, error handling, etc.
 * 
 * # Library initialization & exit
 * 
 * The libhackrf library needs to be initialized in order to use most of its functions. This can be achieved via the function @ref hackrf_init. This initializes internal state and initializes `libusb`. You should only call this function on startup, but it's safe to call it later as well, only it does nothing.
 * 
 * When exiting the program, a call to @ref hackrf_exit should be called. This releases all resources, stops background thread and exits `libusb`. This function should only be called if all streaming is stopped and all devices are closed via @ref hackrf_close, else the error @ref HACKRF_ERROR_NOT_LAST_DEVICE is returned.
 * 
 * # Error handling
 * 
 * Many of the functions in libhackrf can signal errors via returning @ref hackrf_error. This enum is backed by an integer, thus these functions are declared to return an int, but they in fact return an enum variant. The special case @ref HACKRF_SUCCESS signals no errors, so return values should be matched for that. It is also set to the value 0, so boolean conversion can also be used. The function @ref hackrf_error_name can be used to convert the enum into a human-readable string, useful for logging the error.
 * 
 * There is a special variant @ref HACKRF_TRUE, used by some functions that return boolean. This fact is explicitly mentioned at those functions.
 * 
 * Typical error-handling code example:
 * ```c
 *  result = hackrf_init();
 *  if (result != HACKRF_SUCCESS) {
 *      fprintf(stderr,
 *          "hackrf_init() failed: %s (%d)\n",
 *          hackrf_error_name(result),
 *          result);
 *      return EXIT_FAILURE;
 *  }
 * ```
 * 
 * Instead of `if (result != HACKRF_SUCCESS)` the line `if (result)` can also be used with the exact same behaviour.
 * 
 * The special case @ref HACKRF_TRUE is only used by @ref hackrf_is_streaming
 * 
 * # Enum conversion
 * 
 * Most of the enums defined in libhackrf have a corresponding `_name` function that converts the enum value into a human-readable string. All strings returned by these functions are statically allocated and do not need to be `free`d. An example is the already mentioned @ref hackrf_error_name function for the @ref hackrf_error enum.
 * 
 * # Library internals
 * 
 * The library uses `libusb` (version 1.0) to communicate with HackRF hardware. It uses both the synchronous and asynchronous API for communication (asynchronous for streaming data to/from the device, and synchronous for everything else). The asynchronous API requires to periodically call a variant of `libusb_handle_events`, so the library creates a new "transfer thread" for each device doing that using the `pthread` library. The library uses multiple transfers for each device (@ref hackrf_get_transfer_queue_depth).
 *
 * # USB API versions
 * As all functionality of HackRF devices requires cooperation between the firmware and the host, both devices can have outdated software. If host machine software is outdated, the new functions will be unavailable in `hackrf.h`, causing linking errors. If the device firmware is outdated, the functions will return @ref HACKRF_ERROR_USB_API_VERSION.
 * Since device firmware and USB API are separate (but closely related), USB API has its own version numbers.
 * Here is a list of all the functions that require a certain minimum USB API version, up to version 0x0107
 * ## 0x0102
 * - @ref hackrf_set_hw_sync_mode
 * - @ref hackrf_init_sweep

/**
 * @defgroup device Device listing, opening, closing and querying
 * 
 * @brief Managing HackRF devices and querying information about them
 * 
 * The libhackrf library interacts via HackRF hardware through a @ref hackrf_device handle. This handle is opaque, meaning its fields are internal to the library and should not be accessed by user code. To use a device, it first needs to be opened, than it can be interacted with, and finally the device needs to be closed via @ref hackrf_close.
 * 
 * # Opening devices
 * 
 * ## Open first device
 * 
 * @ref hackrf_open opens the first USB device (chosen by libusb). Useful if only one HackRF device is expected to be present.
 * 
 * ## Open by serial
 * 
 * @ref hackrf_open_by_serial opens a device by a given serial (suffix). If no serial is specified it defaults to @ref hackrf_open
 * 
 * ## Open by listing
 * 
 * All connected HackRF devices can be listed via @ref hackrf_device_list. The list must be freed by @ref hackrf_device_list_free.
 * 
 * This struct lists all devices and their serial numbers. Any one of them can be opened by @ref hackrf_device_list_open. All the fields should be treated read-only!
 * 
 * # Closing devices
 * 
 * If the device is not needed anymore, then it can be closed via @ref hackrf_close. Closing a device terminates all ongoing transfers, and resets the device to IDLE mode.
 * 
 * # Querying device information
 * 
 * ## Board ID
 * 
 * Board ID identifies the type of HackRF board connected. See the enum @ref hackrf_board_id for possible values. The value can be read by @ref hackrf_board_id_read and converted into a human-readable string using @ref hackrf_board_id_name. When reading, the initial value of the enum should be @ref BOARD_ID_UNDETECTED.
 * 
 * ## Version string
 * 
 * Version string identifies the firmware version on the board. It can be read with the function @ref hackrf_version_string_read
 * 
 * ## USB API version
 * 
 * USB API version identifies the USB API supported by the device's firmware. It is coded as a xx.xx 16-bit value, and can be read by @ref hackrf_usb_api_version_read
 * 
 * Example of reading firmware and USB API version (from [hackrf_info.c](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/hackrf/blob/eff4a20022ca5d7f11405c3cdeea6c4195e347d0/host/hackrf-tools/src/hackrf_info.c#L157-L178)):
 * 
 *  ```c
 *  result = hackrf_version_string_read(device, &version[0], 255);
 *  if (result != HACKRF_SUCCESS) {
 *      fprintf(stderr,
 *          "hackrf_version_string_read() failed: %s (%d)\n",
 *          hackrf_error_name(result),
 *          result);
 *      return EXIT_FAILURE;
 *  }
 *
 *
 *  result = hackrf_usb_api_version_read(device, &usb_version);
 *  if (result != HACKRF_SUCCESS) {
 *      fprintf(stderr,
 *          "hackrf_usb_api_version_read() failed: %s (%d)\n",
 *          hackrf_error_name(result),
 *          result);
 *      return EXIT_FAILURE;
 *  }
 *  printf("Firmware Version: %s (API:%x.%02x)\n",
 *      version,
 *      (usb_version >> 8) & 0xFF,
 *      usb_version & 0xFF);
 *  ```
 * 
 * 
 * ## Part ID and serial number
 * 
 * The part ID and serial number of the MCU. Read via @ref hackrf_board_partid_serialno_read. See the documentation of the MCU for details.
 * 
 * ## Board revision
 * 
 * Board revision identifies revision of the HackRF board inside a device. Read via @ref hackrf_board_rev_read and converted into a human-readable string via @ref hackrf_board_rev_name. See @ref hackrf_board_rev for possible values. When reading, the value should be initialized with @ref BOARD_REV_UNDETECTED
 * 
 * ## Supported platform
 * 
 * Identifies the platform supported by the firmware of the HackRF device. Read via @ref hackrf_supported_platform_read. Returns a bitfield. Can identify bad firmware version on device.
 *

/**
 * @defgroup configuration Configuration of the RF hardware
 * 
 * @brief Configuring gain, sample rate, filter bandwidth, etc.
 * 
 * # Amplifiers and gains
 * 
 * There are 5 different amplifiers in the HackRF One. Most of them have variable gain, but some of them can be either enabled / disabled. Please note that most of the gain settings are not precise, and they depend on the used frequency as well.
 * 
 * ![hackrf components](https://hackrf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/block-diagram.png)
 * 
 * (image taken from https://hackrf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardware_components.html)
 * 
 * 
 * ## RX path
 * 
 * - baseband gain in the MAX2837 ("BB" or "VGA") - 0-62dB in 2dB steps, configurable via the @ref hackrf_set_vga_gain function
 * - RX IF gain in the MAX2837 ("IF") - 0-40dB with 8dB steps, configurable via the @ref hackrf_set_lna_gain function
 * - RX RF amplifier near the antenna port ("RF") - 0 or ~11dB, either enabled or disabled via the @ref hackrf_set_amp_enable (same function is used for enabling/disabling the TX RF amp in TX mode)
 * 
 * ## TX path
 * - TX IF gain in the MAX2837 ("IF" or "VGA") - 0-47dB in 1dB steps, configurable via @ref hackrf_set_txvga_gain
 * - TX RF amplifier near the antenna port ("RF") - 0 or ~11dB, either enabled or disabled via the @ref hackrf_set_amp_enable (same function is used for enabling/disabling the RX RF amp in RX mode)
 * 
 * # Tuning
 * 
 * The HackRF One can tune to nearly any frequency between 1-6000MHz (and the theoretical limit is even a bit higher). This is achieved via up/downconverting the RF section of the MAX2837 transceiver IC with the RFFC5072 mixer/synthesizer's local oscillator. The mixer produces the sum and difference frequencies of the IF and LO frequencies, and a LPF or HPF filter can be used to select one of the resulting frequencies. There is also the possibility to bypass the filter and use the IF as-is. The IF and LO frequencies can be programmed independently, and the behaviour is selectable. See the function @ref hackrf_set_freq_explicit for more details on it.
 * 
 * There is also the convenience function @ref hackrf_set_freq that automatically select suitable LO and IF frequencies and RF path for a desired frequency. It should be used in most cases.
 * 
 * # Filtering
 * 
 * The MAX2837 has an internal selectable baseband filter for both RX and TX. Its width can be set via @ref hackrf_set_baseband_filter_bandwidth, but only some values are valid. Valid values can be acquired via the functions @ref hackrf_compute_baseband_filter_bw_round_down_lt and @ref hackrf_compute_baseband_filter_bw.
 * 
 * **NOTE** in order to avoid aliasing, the bandwidth should not exceed the sample rate. As a sensible default, the firmware auto-sets the baseband filter bandwidth to a value \f$ \le 0.75 \cdot F_s \f$ whenever the sample rate is changed, thus setting a custom value should be done after setting the samplerate.
 * 
 * # Sample rate
 * 
 * The sample rate of the ADC/DAC can be set between 2-20MHz via @ref hackrf_set_sample_rate or @ref hackrf_set_sample_rate_manual. This also automatically adjusts the baseband filter bandwidth to a suitable value.
 * 
 * # Clocking
 * 
 * The HackRF one has external clock input and clock output connectors for 10MHz 3.3V clock signals. It automatically switches to the external clock if it's detected, and its status is readable with @ref hackrf_get_clkin_status. The external clock can be enabled by the @ref hackrf_set_clkout_enable function.
 * 
 * # Bias-tee
 * 
 * The HackRF one has a built in bias-tee (also called (antenna) port power in some of the documentation) capable of delivering 50mA@3V3 for powering small powered antennas or amplifiers. It can be enabled via the @ref hackrf_set_antenna_enable function. Please note that when the device is returning to IDLE mode, the firmware automatically disables this feature. This means it can't be enabled permanently like with the RTL-SDR, and all software using the HackRF must enable this separately.

/**
 * @defgroup streaming Transmit & receive operation
 * 
 * @brief RX and TX, callbacks
 * 
 * ## Streaming
 * 
 * There are 3 different streaming modes supported by HackRF:
 * - transmitting (TX)
 * - receiving (RX)
 * - swept receiving (SWEEP)
 * 
 * Each mode needs to be initialized before use, then the mode needs to be entered with the `hackrf_start_*` function. Data transfer happens through callbacks.
 * 
 * There are 3 types of callbacks in the library:
 * - transfer callback
 * - flush callback
 * - block complete callback
 * 
 * Steps for starting an RX or TX operation:
 * - initialize libhackrf
 * - open device
 * - setup device (frequency, samplerate, gain, etc.)
 * - setup callbacks, start operation (`hackrf_start_*`)
 * - the main program should go to sleep
 * - when done, the transfer callback should return non-zero value, and signal the main thread to stop
 * - stop operation via `hackrf_stop_*`
 * - close device, exit library, etc.
 * 
 * Data is transferred through the USB connection via setting up multiple async libusb transfers (@ref hackrf_get_transfer_queue_depth). In TX mode, the transfers needs to be filled before submitting, and in RX mode, they need to be read out when they are done. This is done using the transfer callback - it receives a @ref hackrf_transfer object and needs to transfer the data to/from it. As it's needed for all operations, this gets called whenever we need to move data, so every time a transfer is finished (and before the first transfer in TX mode). There's a "transfer complete callback" that only gets called when a transfer is completed. It does not need to do anything special tho, and is optional.
 * 
 * Streaming can be stopped via returning a non-zero value from the transfer callback, but that does NOT reset the device to IDLE mode, it only stops data transfers. In TX mode, when this happens, and the transmitter runs out of data to transmit, it will start transmitting all 0 values (but in older firmware versions, it started repeating the last buffer). To actually stop the operation, a call to `hackrf_stop_*` is needed. Since the callback operate in an async libusb context, such a call can't be made from there, only from the main thread, so it must be signaled through some means (for example, a global variable, or better, a `pthread_cond`) to stop. In RX mode, this signaling can be done from the transfer callback, but in TX mode, we must make sure that we only stop the operation when the last transfer is completed and the device transmitted it, or we might lose it. For this reason, the third **flush callback** exists, that gets called when this happens. It is advised to only signal the main thread to stop from this callback.
 * 
 * The function @ref hackrf_is_streaming can be used to check if the device is streaming or not.
 * 
 * ### Transfer callback
 * 
 * Set when starting an operation with @ref hackrf_start_tx, @ref hackrf_start_rx or @ref hackrf_start_rx_sweep. This callback supplies / receives data. This function takes a @ref hackrf_transfer struct as a parameter, and fill/read data to/from its buffer. This function runs in an async libusb context, meaning it should not interact with the libhackrf library in other ways. The callback can return a boolean value, if its return value is non-zero then it won't be called again, meaning that no future transfers will take place, and (in TX case) the flush callback will be called shortly.
 * 
 * ### Block complete callback
 * 
 * This callback is optional, and only applicable in TX mode. It gets called whenever a data transfer is finished, and can read the data. It needs to do nothing at all. This callback can be set using @ref hackrf_set_tx_block_complete_callback
 * 
 * ### Flush callback
 * 
 * This callback is optional, and only applicable in TX mode. It get called when the last transfer is completed, and it's advisable to only stop streaming via this callback. This callback can be set using @ref hackrf_enable_tx_flush
 * 
 * ### Example TX code utilizing the transfer and flush callbacks.

 * This code can be compiled using `gcc -o triangle triangle.c -lm -lhackrf`. It generates and transmits a 440Hz triangle wave using FM modulation on the 2m HAM band (**check your local laws and regulations on transmitting and only transmit on bands you have license to!**).
 * 
 * For a more complete example, including error handling and more settings, see [hackrf_transfer.c](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/hackrf/blob/master/host/hackrf-tools/src/hackrf_transfer.c)
 * 
 * ## Underrun and overrun
 * 
 * Underrun/overrun detection can be enabled using @ref hackrf_set_tx_underrun_limit or @ref hackrf_set_rx_overrun_limit limit. This causes the HackRF to stop operation if more than the specified amount of samples get lost, for example in case of your program crashing, USB connection failure, etc.
 * 
 * ## Sweeping
 * 
 * Sweeping mode is kind of special. In this mode, the device can be programmed to a list of frequencies to tune on, record set amount of samples and then tune to the next frequency and repeat. It can be setup via @ref hackrf_init_sweep and started with @ref hackrf_start_rx_sweep. In this mode, **the callback does not receive raw samples**, but blocks of samples prefixed with a frequency header specifying the tuned frequency.
 * 
 * See [hackrf_sweep.c](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/hackrf/blob/master/host/hackrf-tools/src/hackrf_sweep.c#L236-L249) for a full example, and especially [the start of the RX callback](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/hackrf/blob/eff4a20022ca5d7f11405c3cdeea6c4195e347d0/host/hackrf-tools/src/hackrf_sweep.c#L236-L249) for parsing the frequency header.
 * 
 * ## HW sync mode
 * 
 * @ref hackrf_set_hw_sync_mode can be used to setup HW sync mode ([see the documentation on this mode](https://hackrf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardware_triggering.html)). This mode allows multiple HackRF Ones to synchronize operations, or one HackRF One to synchronize on an external trigger source.

/**
 * @defgroup debug Firmware flashing & debugging
 * @brief Firmware flashing and directly accessing hardware components
 * 
 * 
 * # Firmware flashing
 * 
 * **IMPORTANT** You should try to use the existing flashing utilities (`hackrf_spiflash`) to flash new firmware to the device! Incorrect usage of the SPIFLASH functions (especially @ref hackrf_spiflash_erase an @ref hackrf_spiflash_write) can brick the device, and DFU mode will be needed to unbrick it!
 * 
 * Firmware flashing can be achieved via writing to the SPI flash holding the firmware of the ARM microcontroller. This can be achieved by the `hackrf_spiflash_*` functions.
 * 
 * The Spartan II CPLD inside the HackRF One devices could also be reconfigured in the past, but in newer firmwares, the ARM MCU automatically reconfigures it on startup with a bitstream baked into the firmware image, thus the function @ref hackrf_cpld_write has no effect, and CPLD flashing can only be done by building a custom firmware (or the automatic loading can be disabled this way as well). The function @ref hackrf_cpld_write and the util `hackrf_cpldjtag` are **deprecated** and only kept for backward compatibility with older firmware versions.
 *  
 * # Debugging
 * 
 * The functions in this section can be used to directly read/write internal registers of the chips inside a HackRF One unit. See the page  <a href="https://hackrf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardware_components.html">Hardware Components</a> for more details on them.
 * 
 * Here's a brief introduction on the various chips in the HackRF One unit:
 * 
 * ## MAX2837 2.3 to 2.7 GHz transceiver
 * This transceiver chip is the RF modulator/demodulator of the HackRF One. This chip sends/receives analog I/Q samples to/from the MAX5864 ADC/DAC chip.
 * 
 * Its registers are accessible through the functions @ref hackrf_max2837_read and @ref hackrf_max2837_write
 * 
 * ## MAX5864 ADC/DAC
 * This chip converts received analog I/Q samples to digital and transmitted I/Q samples to analog. It connects to the main ARM MCU through the CPLD. No configuration is needed for it, only the sample rate can be set via the clock generator IC.
 * 
 * ## Si5351C Clock generator
 * This chip supplies clock signals to all of the other chips. It can synthesize a wide range of frequencies from its clock inputs (internal or external). It uses a fixed 800-MHz internal clock (synthesized via a PLL).
 * 
 * Its registers are accessible through the functions @ref hackrf_si5351c_read and @ref hackrf_si5351c_write
 * 
 * ## RFFC5072 Synthesizer/mixer
 * This mixer mixes the RF signal with an internally synthesized local oscillator signal and thus results in the sum and difference frequencies. Combined with the LPF or HPF filters and the frequency setting in the MAX2837 IC it can be used to tune to any frequency in the 0-6000MHz range.
 * 
 * Its registers are accessible through the functions @ref hackrf_rffc5071_read and @ref hackrf_rffc5071_write
 * 
 * ## LPC4320 ARM MCU
 * This is the main processor of the unit. It's a multi-core ARM processor. It's configured to boot from a W25Q80B SPI flash, but can also be booted from DFU in order to unbrick a bricked unit. It communicated with the host PC via USB.
 * 
 * Some operation details are available via the function @ref hackrf_get_m0_state
 * 
 * ## W25Q80B SPI flash
 * 
 * This chip holds the firmware for the LPC4320 ARM MCU.
 * 
 * It's accessible through the functions @ref hackrf_spiflash_read, @ref hackrf_spiflash_write, @ref hackrf_spiflash_erase, @ref hackrf_spiflash_status and @ref hackrf_spiflash_clear_status
 * 
 * ## XC2C64A CPLD
 * This CPLD sits between the MAX5864 ADC/DAC and the main MCU, and mainly performs data format conversion and some synchronisation.
 * 
 * Its bitstream is auto-loaded on reset by the ARM MCU (from the firmware image), but in older versions, it was possible to reconfigure it via @ref hackrf_cpld_write, and the (since temporarily removed) `hackrf_cpld_checksum` function could verify the firmware in the configuration flash (again, overwritten on startup, so irrelevant).
 * 
 * See <a href="https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/hackrf/issues/609">issue 608</a>, <a href="https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/hackrf/issues/1140">issue 1140</a> and <a href="https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/hackrf/issues/1141">issue 1141</a> for some more details on this!

/**
 * @defgroup operacake Opera Cake add-on board functions
 * 
 * Various functions related to the Opera Cake add-on boards.
 * 
 * These boards are versatile RF switching boards capable of switching two primary ports (A0 and B0) to any of 8 (A1-A4 and B1-B4) secondary ports (with the only rule that A0 and B0 can not be connected to the same side/bank of secondary ports at the same time).
 * 
 * There are 3 operating modes:
 * - manual setup
 * - frequency-based setup
 * - time-based setup
 * 
 * ### Manual setup
 * 
 * This mode allows A0 and B0 to be connected to any of the secondary ports. This mode is configured with @ref hackrf_set_operacake_ports.
 * 
 * ### Frequency-based setup
 * 
 * In this mode the Opera Cake board automatically switches A0 to a port depending on the tuning frequency. Up to @ref HACKRF_OPERACAKE_MAX_FREQ_RANGES frequency ranges can be setup using @ref hackrf_set_operacake_freq_ranges, in a priority order. Port B0 mirrors A0 on the opposite side (but both B and A side ports can be specified for connections to A0)
 * 
 * ### Time-based setup
 * 
 * In this mode the Opera Cake board automatically switches A0 to a port for a set amount of time (specified in samples). Up to @ref HACKRF_OPERACAKE_MAX_DWELL_TIMES times can be setup via @ref hackrf_set_operacake_dwell_times. Port B0 mirrors A0 on the opposite side.
 * 
 * ## Opera Cake setup
 * 
 * Opera Cake boards can be listed with @ref hackrf_get_operacake_boards, but if only one board is connected, than using address 0 defaults to it.
 * 
 * Opera Cake mode can be setup via @ref hackrf_set_operacake_mode, then the corresponding configuration function can be called.
 * 
 * ## Multiple boards
 * 
 * There can be up to @ref HACKRF_OPERACAKE_MAX_BOARDS boards connected to a single HackRF One. They can be assigned individual addresses via onboard jumpers, see the [documentation page](https://hackrf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/opera_cake.html) for details.
 * **Note**: the operating modes of the boards can be set individually via @ref hackrf_set_operacake_mode, but in frequency or time mode, every board configured to that mode will use the same switching plan!
